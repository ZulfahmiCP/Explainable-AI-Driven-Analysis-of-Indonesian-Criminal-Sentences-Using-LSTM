## Executive Summary

This app is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline designed to analyze unstructured Indonesian criminal court decisions (_Putusan Pidana_). By leveraging **Bi-Directional LSTMs** and **Feature Injection techniques**, the system predicts imprisonment duration based on case narratives.

Critically, this project integrates **Explainable AI (LIME)** to ensure transparency, allowing legal practitioners to visualize which specific words (e.g., _residivis_, _sopan_) influenced the model's prediction. This project serves as a foundational step towards building Trustworthy AI in the legal tech domain.

## Business Context & Problem Statement

The Supreme Court of Indonesia processes approximately **100,000 new documents monthly**. Legal practitioners and judicial researchers face a significant "Information Overload" bottleneck. Analyzing consistency in sentencing across thousands of PDF documents is computationally expensive and prone to human error.

**Objective:**
To build a **Data-Centric AI solution** that automates the extraction of legal reasoning and predicts sentencing outcomes, serving as a decision-support system for legal consistency.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Pipeline & Robust Preprocessing

_Relevance: Data Validation & Quality Assurance_

The raw data consists of PDF documents containing OCR artifacts, watermarks, and inconsistent formatting. A rigorous cleaning pipeline was implemented to ensure data quality:

- **Noise Removal:** Regex-based removal of "phantom characters" (e.g., watermark _maa maa_), headers, and footers.
- **Entity Extraction:** Automated extraction of key legal entities:
  - _Articles Charged_ (Pasal)
  - _Prosecutor's Demand_ (Tuntutan)
  - _Mitigating & Aggravating Factors_ (Hal Meringankan/Memberatkan)
- **Feature Injection:** These extracted entities are concatenated with the case narrative to strictly guide the model's attention mechanism.

### 2. Modeling Strategy (Bi-LSTM)

While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the current state-of-the-art, this project utilizes a **Bi-Directional LSTM** to establish a highly efficient, low-latency baseline.

- **Embedding Layer:** Learned dense vector representations of legal terminology.
- **Bi-Directional Wrapper:** Captures sequential context from both past and future tokens, essential for understanding legal negation (e.g., _"Terdakwa **tidak** terbukti..."_).
- **Regression Output:** Predicts a continuous value (months of imprisonment).

### 3. Explainability (XAI)

To address the "Black Box" nature of Neural Networks in high-stakes domains, **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** is implemented.

- **Green Highlights:** Words increasing the sentence duration.
- **Red Highlights:** Words decreasing the sentence duration.
